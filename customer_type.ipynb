    "The purpose of this analysis is to use unsupervised learning to gain information and see patterns related to personality traits and how they affect laptop manufacturer preference, if they do at all. This information will be used to derive insights for Microsoft, both on their current customers and any potential customers. The data being used came from a survey containing questions which can be used to determine personality type, more specifically looking at <a href=\"https://psychcentral.com/lib/the-big-five-personality-traits/\">'The Big Five'</a>, as well as questions about the <a href=\"https://www.hult.edu/blog/why-every-leader-needs-growth-mindset/\">Hult DNA</a> and demographic information.\n",
